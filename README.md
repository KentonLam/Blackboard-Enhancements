# Blackboard Enhancements
Various enhancements to make Blackboard somewhat bearable.

## Blackboard Search Userscript
Press Ctrl+Space to open a search window for easy navigation across courses.

### Install
1. Get TamperMonkey 
([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) 
/ [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)) or equivalent.
2. Install the userscript by opening this link: [blackboard_search.user.js](https://github.com/KentonLam/Blackboard-Enhancements/raw/master/dist/blackboard_search.user.js).
3. Open a Blackboard course page and press Ctrl+Space.
4. Click Options and type your course codes into _Enabled courses_, one course per line.
5. Open the course page of each course and press Ctrl+Space.
6. The search window should now show all your courses. Happy studying!

## Blackboard Style Moderniser
Replaces the low-resolution UQ logo with its vector. 
(Eventually, this should improve more, hence the name)

### Install
Same as above, but install this userscript instead: 
[blackboard_style_moderniser.user.js](https://github.com/KentonLam/Blackboard-Enhancements/raw/master/src/blackboard_style_moderniser.user.js)
